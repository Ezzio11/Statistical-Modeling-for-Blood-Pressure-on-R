# Blood Pressure Analysis Project  

This project analyzes the relationship between blood pressure and various factors to identify potential determinants and risk indicators of hypertension. Conducted using **R**, the study leverages a population dataset containing multiple variables to explore patterns in blood pressure, a critical indicator of cardiovascular health.

---

## **Overview**  
Blood pressure, expressed in millimeters of mercury (mmHg), consists of:  
- **Systolic Pressure**: Pressure in arteries during heartbeats.  
- **Diastolic Pressure**: Pressure in arteries between heartbeats.  

The dataset includes measurements for the following variables:  
- **Age**  
- **BSA (Body Surface Area)**  
- **Weight**  
- **DUR (Drug Utilization Review)**  
- **Pulse**  
- **Stress**

## **Objectives**  
This project focuses on:  
1. **Analyzing Variable Influence**: Investigating whether the variables impact blood pressure.  
2. **Marginal Effects Analysis**: Interpreting the marginal effect of each variable on blood pressure.  

The ultimate goal is to enhance understanding of blood pressure patterns and the factors influencing them, thereby contributing to improved cardiovascular health insights.

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Language**: R  
- **Libraries**: Include libraries such as `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyverse`, and others for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.

## **How to Use the Repository**  
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/blood-pressure-analysis.git
   cd blood-pressure-analysis
   ```

2. **Run the Analysis**  
   Open the R scripts in your preferred R environment (e.g., RStudio) to explore the analysis steps.

3. **Dataset**  
   Replace the placeholder dataset with your own or use the pre-loaded dataset for replication.
